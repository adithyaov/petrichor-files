		["From Kochi, Kerala Thaikkudam Bridge is one of India’s most sought-after rock bands at the moment. Entailing an ingenious fusion of Indian classical and folk sounds with the flair of pop music, their version of musical reverie has seen them being invited to perform at over 400 venues spread across the country. Coming from the length and breadth of the country, the band’s vocalists and instrumentalists make for an ensemble cast which is both versatile and unpredictable. With so many diverse musical, linguistic, and cultural influences the band has always given its audiences a musical experience that is truly global in nature yet local in its idea. It won’t be any different this time as they serenade one and all at Petrichor’s signing-off event.",
